# jackson-bom

A "bill of materials" POM for Jackson dependencies.

## Usage

There are two ways to use the pom: either as parent pom:

```xml
  <parent>
    <groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson</groupId>
    <artifactId>jackson-bom</artifactId>
    <version>2.9.0</version>
  </parent>
```

or by importing just the dependencies:

```xml
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson</groupId>
            <artifactId>jackson-bom</artifactId>
            <version>2.9.0</version>
            <scope>import</scope>
            <type>pom</type>
        </dependency>   
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
```

Two approaches are same with respect to dependency inclusion; latter ONLY includes dependencies,
former includes many other settings.
